# ReacSheet

**ReacSheet** is a React-based application that helps track client details by automatically adding form data to Google Sheets. Built with a MERN stack (React, Node.js, Express) and styled using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.

## Features

- **Form Submission:** Clients submit their details via a form.
- **Data Sync:** Form data is sent to Google Sheets using Google Apps Script.
- **Styling:** Modern UI with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Integration:** Google Apps Script

## How It Works

1. Clients fill out the form.
2. The form data is sent as JSON to a Google Apps Script.
3. The script appends the data to a Google Sheet for tracking.

## Learnings
During this project, I tackled various challenges and expanded my skills:

- **CORS Errors:** Learned how to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing issues effectively.
- **Proxy Server:** Implemented and configured a proxy server for smooth development and API interactions.
- **Library Integration:** Gained hands-on experience with **Tailwind CSS** and **DaisyUI** for modern, responsive design.

This project was a great way to dive into the MERN stack and solve practical problems while learning new skills. ðŸš€
